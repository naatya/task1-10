#### **1.The CIA Triad: The Pillars of Security**



The CIA triad is the industry-standard model for designing security policies.



* ###### **Confidentiality:** Ensuring data is only accessible to authorized users.

&nbsp;	Example: In Banking, your account balance is encrypted so only you and bank staff can see it.



* ###### **Integrity:** Ensuring data is accurate and has not been tampered with.

&nbsp;	Example: In Social Media, if you post a status, integrity ensures that a hacker cannot change the text of your

&nbsp;		 post after it’s published.



* ###### **Availability:** Ensuring systems and data are accessible when needed.

&nbsp;	Example: If a Banking App goes down during a holiday weekend due to a server crash, it is a failure of Availability.





#### **2. The Threat Landscape: Types of Attackers**



###### **Type			    Motivation		  	     Skill Level**

Script Kiddies     	Thrill-seeking or ego; uses pre-made tools.		Low

Insiders   		Revenge or financial gain (disgruntled employees).	Varies (but has high access)

Hacktivists		"Political or social change (e.g., Anonymous)."		Moderate to High

Nation-State Actors	"Espionage, sabotage, or geopolitical advantage."	Extremely High



##### **3. Attack Surfaces: Where the Doors Are**



The attack surface is the total sum of all possible points where an unauthorized user can try to enter or extract data.



* **Web/Mobile Apps:** Vulnerabilities in the code (like a login form).



* **APIs:** The "glue" connecting apps; if unsecured, they can leak massive databases.



* **Network:** Wi-Fi, routers, and firewalls.



* **Cloud Infrastructure:** Misconfigured S3 buckets or cloud permissions.



##### **5. Mapping Daily Apps to Attack Surfaces**



App		Primary Attack Surface		Risk Scenario

Email		Network / Social Engineering	Phishing links used to steal credentials.

WhatsApp	Mobile App / API		Exploiting a bug in the app code to intercept messages.

Banking		Web App / Database		SQL injection to change account balances.



##### **6. The Data Flow \& 7. Where Attacks Happen**



In a typical architecture, data moves in a specific path. Security must be applied at every "hop.



1. **"User-->Application:** The user enters a password.
 Attack: Phishing or Keylogging (stealing the password at the source).
   
2. **Application-->Server:** The app sends the data over the internet.
    Attack: Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) (intercepting data while in transit).
   
3. **Server-->Database:** The server asks the database to verify the user.
    Attack: SQL Injection (tricking the database into dumping all user records).
   
4. **Database Storage:** Data sits on a disk.

   Attack: Data Breach (stealing the physical or virtual storage drives).
